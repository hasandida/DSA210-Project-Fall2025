# The Anatomy of Victory: A Win-Prediction Analysis for League of Legends

## 1. Project Description
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of League of Legends ranked game data to answer a central question: How does in-game factors contribute to chances of victory within a game? Which in-game factors are the most powerful predictors of a win?

Players often debate the value of specific objectives such as `firstBlood` vs. `firstTower`, this project aims to move beyond single statistics. It uses a large dataset to build a machine learning model that weighs the collective importance of multiple factors—including major and basic objectives, team composition ("champion classes"), and economic advantages—to determine the "anatomy" of a winning game.

## 2. Motivation
As a long-time League of Legends player, I have always been interested in the data behind the game's strategies. What truly wins a game has been a constant debate since I have started playing this game, I have witnessed these debates during my games and across many forums. These arguments, however, are mostly based on personal experiences and opinions of the players themselves. The goal of this project is to apply the data science techniques from DSA 210 to statistically test these theories, quantify the value of objectives, and build a model that reflects the true drivers of victory.
